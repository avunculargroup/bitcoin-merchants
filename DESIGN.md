# Visual Design Proposal for the BTCMap Onboarding Portal (Home Page)

## 1 Objectives and Audience

The BTCMap onboarding portal aims to make it **simple and inviting** for Australian small‑business owners to add their Bitcoin‑accepting businesses to a public map. The home page must:

- **Communicate purpose quickly.** Users form opinions about a website in about 0.05 seconds[\[1\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/); the page needs to reassure visitors that the service is legitimate and that it will be easy to use.
- **Encourage sign‑up by lowering friction.** A clear step‑by‑step process, optional email notification and an accessible open‑source CAPTCHA (ALTCHA) should make the submission journey painless.
- **Build trust with Australian audiences.** Research shows that consumers strongly prefer to purchase from .au domains; three‑quarters of Australians are more likely to trust a business whose site ends in ".au"[\[2\]](https://www.auda.org.au/news-insights/statements/australians-seek-au-online-as-a-marker-of-trust/), and half will only buy from such sites[\[3\]](https://www.auda.org.au/news-insights/statements/australians-seek-au-online-as-a-marker-of-trust/). The design will emphasise Australian identity, local currency, and a "100 % Australian Owned" badge.

## 2 Design Goals and Trust Principles

The following principles guide the design:

- **Professional first impression.** A clean, modern layout with consistent spacing and alignment tells visitors that the business is legitimate[\[4\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/). High‑quality images and graphics enhance professionalism and authenticity[\[5\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/).
- **Clarity and simplicity.** A clutter‑free structure makes content easy to understand[\[6\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/) and fosters trust[\[7\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/). Use concise, jargon‑free copy that answers key questions ("What does this portal do? Who is it for? Why trust it?") within seconds[\[8\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Intuitive navigation.** Visitors should find information quickly. Clear menu labels, logical content grouping and a visual hierarchy help users feel in control[\[4\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/)[\[9\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/).
- **Mobile‑first responsiveness.** More than half of web traffic comes from mobile devices; responsive layouts and fast load times are essential[\[10\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/)[\[11\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Trust signals.** Include security icons (HTTPS), trust badges (e.g., "100 % Australian Owned", "Bitcoin Accepted"), testimonials, social proof, and clear contact information[\[12\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions)[\[13\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/). Display an SSL padlock and link to a privacy policy to reassure visitors that data is handled responsibly[\[14\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Open‑source, privacy‑friendly bot protection.** ALTCHA blocks 99 % of automated threats without cookies or tracking[\[15\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/); its proof‑of‑work mechanism is user‑friendly and self‑hosted[\[16\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/)[\[17\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/).

## 3 Colour Palette and Branding

Colour choices influence emotions. According to web‑design psychology, **blue** conveys trust and professionalism, **green** represents growth and stability, and **white** embodies simplicity and cleanliness[\[18\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/). These colours will be used consistently across the site:

- **Primary colour - Mid blue:** used in the header, primary call‑to‑action buttons, and active navigation states. It evokes reliability and signals confidence[\[19\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/).
- **Secondary colour - Fresh green:** used for accents, highlights and success messages. It suggests growth and alignment with the Bitcoin and environmental communities[\[20\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/).
- **Neutral palette - Whites and light greys:** used for backgrounds, cards, and form fields to maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic[\[21\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/). Plenty of white space helps content breathe[\[22\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/) and improves readability[\[23\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/).
- **Accent colour - Warm orange:** a contrasting accent for secondary buttons and icons to draw attention without overwhelming the core palette.

The logo (to be designed separately) should incorporate the BTCMap icon alongside a stylised outline of Australia. Use a .au domain (e.g., **btcmap.com.au**) to leverage the trust benefits associated with .au domains[\[24\]](https://www.auda.org.au/news-insights/statements/australians-seek-au-online-as-a-marker-of-trust/).

## 4 Layout and Content Structure

### 4.1 Navigation Bar (Header)

- **Logo and site name:** anchored on the left, linking back to the home page.
- **Menu items:** "How it Works," "Add Your Business," "FAQ," "Contact." Keep labels clear so users know what to expect[\[25\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **CTA button:** a prominent "Get Started" button in primary blue leads directly to the onboarding form.
- **Sticky behaviour:** the header remains visible as users scroll, improving navigation on long pages.

### 4.2 Hero Section

- **Large headline:** communicate the value proposition quickly. For example, "Get Your Business on the Bitcoin Map in Minutes" with a sub‑heading like "Join hundreds of Aussie businesses accepting Bitcoin and bring new customers to your door." The copy should be clear and benefits‑focused[\[26\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Call‑to‑action:** a prominent button ("Add Your Business") invites users to begin the onboarding process.
- **Supporting graphic:** include an abstract illustration of a small‑business owner placing a pin on a map with a Bitcoin icon. A conceptual example is shown below:

- **Quick trust signals:** display the padlock icon (HTTPS), a "100 % Australian Owned" badge[\[27\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions) and a small note "Built on open data (OpenStreetMap)."

### 4.3 Step‑by‑Step Process

Use a three‑column layout with icons and short descriptions:

- **Search your business:** The user searches for their business using an integrated business‑lookup API (e.g., Google Places or another open data service). Provide clear search instructions and highlight that this step is optional-users can add missing businesses manually.
- **Enter details & verify:** Users review pre‑populated details or fill in the business name, address, category, and Bitcoin payment acceptance details. Include the optional email field so they can be notified when the listing goes live. Use a secure, accessible form with ALTCHA for spam prevention[\[15\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/).
- **Submit & get listed:** Explain that the submission will be reviewed by the BTCMap team and uploaded to OpenStreetMap. Set expectations about review time and emphasise that data is handled responsibly.

Each step should have an icon (search, edit, tick) and short explanatory text. Use green ticks and icons to reinforce progress and success.

### 4.4 Benefits and Social Proof

Create a section that answers the question "Why add my business?" with bullet points such as:

- **Reach new customers:** Bitcoin enthusiasts look for places to spend sats; listing your business expands your audience.
- **Easy & free:** It takes only a few minutes and costs nothing.
- **Open and transparent:** Data is stored openly on OpenStreetMap, ensuring longevity and community oversight.

Adjacent to this, show **testimonials** from early adopters. Research shows social proof such as customer reviews and case studies significantly enhances credibility[\[28\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions)[\[29\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/). Include quotes, names, and business types to make testimonials feel authentic[\[30\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).

### 4.5 Security, Privacy & Trust Badges

Dedicate a panel to reassure visitors:

- **Privacy‑first CAPTCHA:** Explain that ALTCHA protects against bots without tracking users; it uses a proof‑of‑work mechanism and is open‑source[\[15\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/)[\[16\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/)[\[17\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/). Include the ALTCHA logo and a brief caption.
- **Data protection:** Provide a link to the privacy policy and summarise how user data (business information and optional email) is stored and used. Highlight compliance with Australian privacy laws[\[31\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Australian trust marks:** Show badges like "100 % Australian Owned," ".au domain," and membership in relevant associations. These badges communicate credibility and local ownership[\[27\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions).

### 4.6 FAQ and Resources

Offer an expandable FAQ section addressing common questions: "Why should I list my business?", "Can I edit my information later?", "How do you verify submissions?", "What if my business is not on the map?". Clear, concise answers reduce friction and build trust.

Link to a **Resources** page where users can learn more about Bitcoin, OpenStreetMap and the BTCMap project.

### 4.7 Footer

The footer should provide:

- **Contact information:** display an email address, phone number, and office location (if applicable). Transparent contact details build trust[\[13\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/)[\[32\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/).
- **Useful links:** privacy policy, terms of use, open data licensing, main BTCMap site, and social media profiles.
- **Acknowledgement:** recognise Indigenous lands and communities, reflecting respect and cultural awareness (optional but recommended for Australian businesses).
- **Newsletter sign‑up:** a simple form allowing users to receive updates about BTCMap and Bitcoin adoption (optional). Keep the sign‑up optional and clearly state that the email will only be used for notifications.

## 5 User Experience and Accessibility

- **Responsive design:** ensure the layout adapts fluidly across desktop, tablet and mobile devices[\[33\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/). Use collapsible menus, touch‑friendly buttons and appropriate font sizes.
- **Fast load times:** compress images, lazy‑load non‑critical assets and minimise JavaScript to keep pages under the three‑second load threshold; over half of users will abandon slower sites[\[34\]](https://presstwood.design/5-website-fundamentals-for-building-trust/)[\[35\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/).
- **Accessible forms:** include labels, error messages, and keyboard navigability. ALTCHA's proof‑of‑work approach avoids puzzles and is accessible to all users[\[36\]](https://altcha.org/open-source-captcha/).
- **Concise forms:** collect only necessary information (business name, location, category, Bitcoin acceptance details). Provide optional fields (e.g., email) and reassure users that data is stored securely.
- **Clear CTAs:** each section should end with a call‑to‑action button or link guiding the user forward. Buttons should have high colour contrast for readability and accessibility.
- **Feedback messaging:** show success messages when forms are submitted and error messages when validation fails. Use friendly language and icons.

## 6 Building Trust Throughout the Journey

Trust is not a single element but a combination of design, content and transparency. To maintain trust:

- **Professional design:** keep the design consistent and uncluttered with high‑quality imagery[\[37\]](https://www.sitesbysara.com/the-psychology-of-web-design-how-a-well-designed-website-builds-trust-for-small-businesses/). Avoid generic stock photos; use illustrations that reflect Australian small‑business culture[\[5\]](https://pursuedigital.com.au/the-impact-of-web-design-on-brand-perception-customer-trust/).
- **Authenticity:** highlight real stories from Aussie merchants and feature local imagery. Share case studies to show how listing on BTCMap brought in new customers.
- **Transparent communication:** clearly explain how the data will be used and how long it may take for listings to appear. Provide ways for users to update or remove their information.
- **Visibility of policies:** link privacy policy and terms in the header or footer. Display your SSL certificate and show the padlock in the browser as a subtle but effective trust signal[\[38\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions).
- **Active engagement:** consider adding a live chat or support widget so users can get assistance quickly. Prompt responses build trust and reduce drop‑off[\[39\]](https://marketeam.com.au/resources/articles/digital-marketing/trust-signals-that-increase-ecommerce-conversions).

## 7 Conclusion and Next Steps

The proposed home page design combines a professional aesthetic with clear, human‑centred messaging to encourage Australian small businesses to list on BTCMap. By focusing on strong first impressions, intuitive navigation, local trust signals (e.g., .au domain, Australian Owned badge), and privacy‑friendly spam protection, the portal can build credibility and encourage adoption.

This proposal should guide UI mockups and development in Next.js with Tailwind CSS and ShadUI components. Further usability testing with Australian small‑business owners will ensure the design resonates and improves trust and conversion.
