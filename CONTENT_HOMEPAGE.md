**Who needs a 3 % card fee?**  
Traditional card payments are expensive for small merchants - fees often exceed 1½-2 % of the sale value, and transactions on foreign‑issued cards can cost **around 2.5 %**[\[1\]](https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/2024-10/issues-for-consultation.html#:~:text=paid%20by%20small%20merchants%20also,Graph%C2%A04)[\[2\]](https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/2024-10/issues-for-consultation.html#:~:text=%2A%20Transactions%20on%20foreign,6%C2%A0per%C2%A0cent). When the median profit margin for an Australian small business is only **≈5 %**[\[3\]](https://yoursmallbusinesscoach.com.au/what-is-a-reasonable-profit-margin-for-small-business/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20The%20Average%20Profit%20Margin,For%20Small%20Business%20In%20Australia) and average net margins range from **7-10 %**[\[4\]](https://yoursmallbusinesscoach.com.au/what-is-a-reasonable-profit-margin-for-small-business/#:~:text=In%20summary%20understanding%20profit%20margin,to%20help%20your%20business%20grow), paying two percent in fees means handing over a large share of your hard‑earned profit.

## FAQ

**What is bitcoin?**  
Bitcoin is a digital currency that works through a **peer‑to‑peer network**, meaning users transact directly with one another without intermediaries. Each node in the network keeps a copy of the public ledger (the blockchain) and uses **cryptography to verify transactions**, ensuring that coins cannot be spent twice[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#:~:text=currency%20before%20revoking%20it%20.,10).

**How do bitcoin payments work?**  
Payments can be made on‑chain or via the Lightning Network. Lightning is a second‑layer protocol that allows many off‑chain transfers before settling on the blockchain. It enables **fast, scalable transactions with very low fees**, making micro‑payments practical[\[5\]](https://www.lightspark.com/knowledge/how-the-lightning-network-is-transforming-bitcoin#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20is%20a,chain). A POS or payment processor generates a Lightning invoice (usually as a QR code). The customer scans and pays; funds are available instantly[\[5\]](https://www.lightspark.com/knowledge/how-the-lightning-network-is-transforming-bitcoin#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20is%20a,chain).

**What are the fees?**  
Card payment fees for small merchants in Australia typically range from **1.5 % to 2 %**, and transactions on foreign cards cost **around 2.5 %**[\[1\]](https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/2024-10/issues-for-consultation.html#:~:text=paid%20by%20small%20merchants%20also,Graph%C2%A04)[\[2\]](https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/2024-10/issues-for-consultation.html#:~:text=%2A%20Transactions%20on%20foreign,6%C2%A0per%C2%A0cent). In contrast, Lightning network fees are tiny. Some processors charge less than a cent, and Square even offers **zero processing fees until 2027**[\[7\]](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/square-bitcoin-payments-go-live-today#:~:text=Bitcoin%20just%20took%20another%20major,no%20processing%20fees%20until%202027). Eliminating card fees helps protect your slim profit margins[\[3\]](https://yoursmallbusinesscoach.com.au/what-is-a-reasonable-profit-margin-for-small-business/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20The%20Average%20Profit%20Margin,For%20Small%20Business%20In%20Australia)[\[4\]](https://yoursmallbusinesscoach.com.au/what-is-a-reasonable-profit-margin-for-small-business/#:~:text=In%20summary%20understanding%20profit%20margin,to%20help%20your%20business%20grow).

**Are bitcoin payments volatile?**  
Bitcoin's price can fluctuate. However, many payment processors (including Square's U.S. service and OpenNode) offer automatic conversion to local currency at the time of payment[\[11\]](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/square-bitcoin-payments-go-live-today#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20can%20expand%20your%20customer,%E2%80%9D). You can choose to receive funds in bitcoin, in your local currency, or a mix of both, reducing exposure to price volatility.

**Are there chargebacks?**  
No. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically signed and recorded on a decentralised blockchain, making them **immutable** and irreversible[\[6\]](https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/211162263-Can-My-Transaction-Be-Canceled-or-Reversed#:~:text=We%20understand%20that%20mistakes%20happen%2C,initiated%2C%20it%20cannot%20be%20undone). This eliminates the risk of fraudulent chargebacks and reduces administrative overhead.
